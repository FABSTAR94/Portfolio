                    <h2> Hi, My name is Faviola<br>& this is my journey.</h2>
                    <p>I became interested in learning how to code after highschool but was a bit intimidated. It wasn't until I received my associate's degree in Business Administration when I decided to give coding a try before enrolling into a 4 year University. I attended an intense 9-week coding bootcamp that prepares you on becoming a Fullstack Developer. After the bootcamp, I was amazed on how I was able to build a website from start to finish. My main focus is the front end but I am looking forward on improving my back end skills.</p>
                    <p>I am currently building websites and working on web apps for personal and free-lance projects. I am in search for an Entry Front End Developer, Web Developer, Full Stack Developer position.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have experience with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, SQL, Github, Heroku, Ruby, and Ruby on rails.</p>
